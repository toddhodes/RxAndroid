- load-balanced tomcat hosting:

2 compute instances * $0.085/instance-hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = $122

1 elastic load balance * $0.025/elb-hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = $18



- data processing:

small instance (until we get much more data):
 ($0.085/ec2 + $0.015/amr)  * 8 runs/day * 30 days/month = $24

large instance:
 ($0.34/ec2 + $0.06/amr) * 8 runs/day * 30 days/month = $96
