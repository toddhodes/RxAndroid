- the java API is funky
- methods auth_createToken and auth_getSession really should not be used.
  they are only useful for "desktop" apps, where you need to create a
  "login" link, etc.
- here, in an internal frame webapp, your URL is called with the necessary
  info (session and userId, among other things.)
- you should create FacebookRestClient, passing the session id.  that works.
- you also need to set the userId.  auth_getSession should probably do this,
  but it is unnecessary, and it does not work.  I added a "setUserId" 
  method.

- for cron jobs, you can use a sessionId that never expires.  I created
  one simply by logging in and looking at the sessionId.
