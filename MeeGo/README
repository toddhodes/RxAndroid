The following is information intended to help enable MeeGo interoperation
with the WaveMarket cross-carrier finder API.  It assumes the intended wire
format will be JSON.


api-docs
--------

The api-docs directory contains javadoc describing the full Finder v1 API.
To interact with it via JSON, simply match the method signature with the
corresponding JSON types, enclosing the entire set of one or more arguments
as a JSON list.  URL parameters indicate the service class and method name
to call.


api-src
-------

The api-src directory contains source code for all the java interfaces,
classes, and enums in the API, simply for reference, and/or, to use in
generating matching C++ versions.


finder-json-api
---------------

The finder-json-api directory includes two sample calls to an instance
of the finder v1 API.  It is using some sample credentials and an endpoint

URL: http://meego.location-labs.com:8080/finder-att-family/finderApiJson.svc
phone number: 5551114000
password: madam0

which you are welcome to continue to use.


Illustrated first is a call to authorize the client:

doauth.sh   
  - script that POSTs auth.json to a demo finder API endpoint, returning a result 
    similar to auth.result, or an error
auth.json   
  - auth JSON input
auth.result
  - auth JSON output


Illustrated second is a call to locate the first asset of a client:

doloc.sh
  - script that POSTs loc.json to a demo finder API endpoint, returning a result 
    similar to loc.result and/or loc.result-pending.result, or an error
loc.json
  - locate JSON input
loc.result-pending.result
  - auth JSON output, returned while the locate is still pending a result
loc.result
  - locate JSON output, successful locate response

NOTE: loc.json's sessionId byte[] must replaced by a valid sessionId, as 
      returned by doauth.sh, above.


Finally, a sample error response is illustrated; errors are returned as 
HTTP 500s, with the body containing a JSON-formatted exception message
and the class of the exception

error.json
  - sample error response, where the sessionId is invalid
